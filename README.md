Smart Expense and Budget Manager

Author: Saurabh Chaudhari

Day 1 Smart Expense Management System

On Day 1, I built the foundation of the Smart Expense and Budget Manager using only core Python.
The main focus was to design a structured expense tracking system and understand how real world data can be stored and managed.

Project Understanding

This project works as a simple console based expense tracker where:
User can add daily expenses
Each expense is stored in structured format
Data is managed using list of dictionaries
Categories are controlled using tuple
Total spending is calculated dynamically
The goal is to simulate how financial data can be collected and processed before doing analytics.

What I Implemented

Fixed categories using tuple
Expense storage using list of dictionaries
add_expense function for taking structured user input
Category validation logic
view_expenses function to display records properly
calculate_total function using map and reduce
Clean function based code structure

Key Concepts Practiced

Data handling using list and dictionary
Input validation using condition statements
String methods like strip and lower
Loop for structured data display
Functional programming approach using map and reduce

Learning Outcomes

Understood how real world data can be structured
Improved logical thinking and program flow design
Learned how to break a program into reusable functions
Gained confidence in handling structured data
Strengthened foundation for data analytics projects

Next step will focus on adding budget checking and basic analytics features to make the system more analytical.
